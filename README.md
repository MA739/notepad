## Notepad

This application allows users to take notes and back them up on the cloud. This app has a registration and login page, which creates and accesses accounts for the cloud backup features. Once the user is in the application, they can create new notes and edit or delete old ones. Users can logout from their account and switch between dark and light modes in the setting page.
